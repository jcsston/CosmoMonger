        CosmoMonger is an on-line space-based trading game featuring real-time 
        multi-player interaction.&nbsp; Players own a starship which they use to visit 
        planetary systems.&nbsp; Once in a system, players can buy and sell commodities 
        (both legal and illegal) to earn credits.&nbsp; Gaining credits allows players 
        to buy bigger and more powerful ships.&nbsp; But danger exists side-by-side with 
        free enterprise!&nbsp; The Galactic Police are sworn to stop the influx of 
        contraband, by any means necessary!&nbsp; Vicious pirates seek to part honest 
        merchants from their wares! And most dangerous of all...other players seek fame 
        and profit by attacking their competitors!
